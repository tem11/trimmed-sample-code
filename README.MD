# Simple code sample

This code should show simple implementation of `ArgumentResolver`,
which handles automatic transformation of JsonPayload to the target entity.

### Tech stack
 * PHP 8.0
 * Symfony 5.3

### Note

PaymentController, DTOs & some Exceptions were added just to demo usage
of ArgumentResolvers, and this is not real production code.
